                            the defendant's prior convictions in 2009-CF-748, 2007-CF-748 and
                            2004-CF-2208.  Motion denied as to 2009-CF-948.   People are allowed
                            to use the prior convictions in 2007-CF-748 and 2004-CF-2208 as
                            impeachment material should the defendant testify.  First oral Motion

                            reference made that the officers were attempting to serve a parole
                            warrant.  Motion allowed.  Warrant should be addressed as either
                            warrant or arrest warrant and not a parole warrant.  Second Motion in
                            Limine by Assistant Public Defender Kuehl that no reference be made
                            that the defendant has been known as Antwan Carter, an alias.  Motion
                            allowed.   Stipulation that the causes to be used as possible
                            impeachment material for Antwan Carter are the same person as the
                            defendant in this cause.  Third Motion in Limine by Assistant Public
                            Defender Kuehl that the People be barred from referring to what the
                            defendant thought was drugs during his flight.  Motion allowed.
                            People are barred from referring to what the defendant thought was

                            mistrial under Batson.  Based on the representations made by Assistant
                            State's Attorney Larson and the Court's own observations of the voir
                            dire examination process, the court finds justifications advanced by
                            Mr. Larson are in fact non-discriminatory bases for his exercise of
                            preemptory challenges that he is afforded.  Motion for mistrial under
                            Batson is denied.   Jurors brought back into open court.  Oath to Jury
                            after Voir Dire conducted.  Opening statements heard.  Testimony

                            presents no evidence.  Renewed motion on behalf of the defendant for
                            directed verdict at the close of all the evidence.  Motion denied.
                            Jury instruction conference held.  Cause allotted for continued jury
                            trial on February 26, 2014 at 9:30 a.m. in Courtroom A.
   02-26-14       
                            Defendant appears with James Kuehl.  Jury trial in progress resumed.
                            Jury instruction conference concluded.  Closing arguments heard.  Jury
                            instructed as to the law and retire to deliberate.
                            Jury returns in open court with the following verdict:
                            We, the jury, find the defendant Antwan Brown guilty of aggravated
                            battery to Cory Koker.
                            Court accepts the verdict of the jury.  Judgment entered in accordance
                            with the verdict of the jury.
                            Court finds the jurors are hopeless deadlocked as to the offense of
                            aggravated battery to Elizabeth Ronk.  Court declares a miss trial as
                            to the offense of aggravated battery to Elizabeth Ronk.
