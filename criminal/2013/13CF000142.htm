                            Defendant arraigned.  The Champaign County Public Defender is
                            appointed and Lindsey Yanchus appears instanter.  Defendant waives
                            preliminary hearing, enters a plea of not guilty and requests trial by
                            jury.  Pre-trial orders entered.  Bond is to continue as transferred.
                            Cause called for Risk Assessment hearing. Reports on file. Evidence
                            and Arguments heard. The Court finds the Defendant remains at risk to
                            violate order of protection. The Court orders Defendant as a condition
                            of bond to submit to continued electronic monitoring, pending further
                            order of Court. Defendant's bond is modified to allow Defendant to
                            leave the State of Illinois for the purpose of residence, provided
                            that said travel does NOT impair the Court's Order regarding
                            electronic monitoring.
