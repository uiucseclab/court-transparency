                            treatment on an in-patient basis in a secure setting.  It is ordered
                            that the defendant shall be placed in the custody of the Illinois

                            treatment plans in writing to the Court and a copy to counsel pursuant

                            by this Court believes that Defendant is no longer subject to

                            conditionally released or no longer requires a secure placement, said
