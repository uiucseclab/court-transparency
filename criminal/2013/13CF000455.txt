T AMENDED MOTION
                            TO WITHDRAW GUILTY PLEA AND VACATE SENTENCE.  An ord
er allowing
                            withdrawal of a guilty plea, as Defendant requests,
is appropriate
                            where the plea was entered through a misapprehension
 of the facts or
                            the law or where there is a doubt as to the guilt of
 the accused and
                            justice would be better served through a trial, Peop
le v. Hughes, 2012
                            IL 112 817, 983 N.E. 2d 439, 368 Ill. Dec. 26 (2012)
.  In his AMENDED
                            MOTION TO WITHDRAW GUILTY PLEA AND VACATE THE SENTEN
CE, Defendant
                            alleges, inter alia, that he was "pressured" into pl
eading guilty by
                            his trial counsel, that the People presented perjure
d testimony and
                            altered physical evidence at trial, that his trial c
ounsel failed to
                            impeach the
                            testimony of a key witness for the People and/or pre
sent evidence to
                            rebut her testimony, and that he was improperly sent
enced.  To
                            determine the claims in Defendant's motion, the Cour
t would be
                            required to consider evidence as to conversations th
at occurred out of
                            the Court's presence and documents that were not pre
sented at trial.
                            As Defendant's appeal rights are implicated, the Cou
rt has determined
                            that an evidentiary hearing as to Defendant's AMENDE
D MOTION TO
                            WITHDRAW GUILTY PLEA AND VACATE THE SENTENCE is need
