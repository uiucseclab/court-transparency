   06-30-15                 Record of exhibits received on file.
   07-06-15                 Decision on Defendant's MOTION FOR NEW TRIAL heretofore taken
                            under advisement.
                            On September 17, 2014, the day upon which this cause had been allotted
                            for jury trial, defendant appeared with trial attorney Walter Ding.
                            At that time, Defendant indicated that he wished to waive his right to
                            have a jury trial and have the cause proceed as a bench trial.  In
                            consulting with Defendant prior to September 17, 2014, attorney Ding
                            had advised Defendant of the sentencing range applicable to the charge
                            of DOMESTIC BATTERY WITH A PRIOR DOMESTIC BATTERY CONVICTION but did
                            not advise Defendant of the mandatory supervised release [MSR]
                            component that would be included in any sentence should Defendant be
                            convicted of that charge.  On September 17, 2014, the trial judge
                            interrogated Defendant as to his intent to waive his right to a jury
                            trial to determine whether that election was a voluntary and knowing
                            choice.  During that interrogation, the trial judge erroneously
                            informed Defendant that a one year MSR term would be included in any
                            sentence imposed should defendant be convicted after a trial whereas
                            the actual MSR component of a felony domestic battery sentence is four
                            years [730 ILCS 5/5-8-1(d)(6)].
                            Prior to waiving a fundamental constitutional right, such as the right
                            to a jury trial, a defendant is entitled to complete and accurate
                            information as to the possible, direct consequences of his/her choice.
                            The Court finds that Defendant's waiver of his right to a jury trial
                            on September 17, 2015 was voluntarily but not knowingly made.
                            Defendant's motion for a new trial is granted.  Order of conviction
                            entered October 30, 2014 is vacated.  Order entered September 17,
                            2014, accepting Defendant's waiver of his right to trial by jury is
                            vacated.  Written WAIVER OF JURY, on file, is ordered stricken.  Cause
                            continued for further proceedings 9:00 a.m., July 21, 2015, Courtroom
