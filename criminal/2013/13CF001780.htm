                            date.

                            provided to the State with notice directing the State to file any
                            responsive pleadings, courtesy copy to the court and petitioner, on or
                            before September 15, 2014.

                            See Order.  The Court finds the petition fails to state a claim for
                            relief under 735 ILCS 5/2-1401.  The petition is both legally and
                            factually insufficient, it lacks any arguable factual basis and there
                            is no evidentiary support for the petitioner's allegations.  The
                            issues raised in the petition seeking post-judgment relief are
                            frivolous and patently without merit.  The Court orders summary
                            judgment for the State and against the petitioner on the pleadings and
                            the petitioner's request for post judgment relief is denied.
