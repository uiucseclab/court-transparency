                            Court notes Motion to Dismiss filed by the State on January 25, 2016.
                            Petitioner's Response to the Motion to Dismiss must be filed no later
                            than March 4, 2016.  No hearing is required on the Motion to Dismiss,
                            and the Court anticipates ruling by March 31, 2016.  Court Clerk to
                            notify Defendant of the entry of this docket Order.

                            Motion to Vacate Judgement and Order on file by Defendant, Pro Se
   02-25-16                 Docket Entry
                            Defendant's Motion to Vacate Judgment and Order filed February 22,
                            2016, is DENIED AS PREMATURE.  The Court has not yet entered any order
                            on the State's Motion to Dismiss, and Defendant's Petition for Relief
                            from Judgment filed December 28, 2015, is STILL PENDING.  The Court's
                            docket entry of February 4, 2016, merely set a deadline for Defendant
                            to file a Response to the State's Motion to Dismiss by March 4, 2016,
                            but Defendant's Motion to Vacate reflects a mistaken belief that the
                            Court had ruled on the State's Motion.  The deadline for Defendant to
                            file a Response to the State's Motion to Dismiss is extended to March
                            31, 2016.
