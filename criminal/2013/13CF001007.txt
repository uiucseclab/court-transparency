ore taken
                            under advisement.
                            On September 17, 2014, the day upon which this cause
 had been allotted
                            for jury trial, defendant appeared with trial attorn
ey Walter Ding.
                            At that time, Defendant indicated that he wished to
waive his right to
                            have a jury trial and have the cause proceed as a be
nch trial.  In
                            consulting with Defendant prior to September 17, 201
4, attorney Ding
                            had advised Defendant of the sentencing range applic
able to the charge
                            of DOMESTIC BATTERY WITH A PRIOR DOMESTIC BATTERY CO
NVICTION but did
                            not advise Defendant of the mandatory supervised rel
ease [MSR]
                            component that would be included in any sentence sho
uld Defendant be
                            convicted of that charge.  On September 17, 2014, th
e trial judge
                            interrogated Defendant as to his intent to waive his
 right to a jury
                            trial to determine whether that election was a volun
tary and knowing
                            choice.  During that interrogation, the trial judge
erroneously
                            informed Defendant that a one year MSR term would be
 included in any
                            sentence imposed should defendant be convicted after
 a trial whereas
                            the actual MSR component of a felony domestic batter
y sentence is four
                            years [730 ILCS 5/5-8-1(d)(6)].
                            Prior to waiving a fundamental constitutional right,
 such as the right
                            to a jury trial, a defendant is entitled to complete
 and accurate
                            information as to the possible, direct consequences
of his/her choice.
                            The Court finds that Defendant's waiver of his right
 to a jury trial
                            on September 17, 2015 was voluntarily but not knowin
gly made.
                            Defendant's motion for a new trial is granted.  Orde
r of conviction
                            entered October 30, 2014 is vacated.  Order entered
September 17,
                            2014, accepting Defendant's waiver of his right to t
rial by jury is
                            vacated.  Written WAIVER OF JURY, on file, is ordere
