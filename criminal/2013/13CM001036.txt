pon review of the

e judicial notice,
                            the court finds that there exists reason to believe
that the defendant
                            is a disabled adult as defined in Article 11a of the
 Probate Act.
                            Accordingly, the court appoints Andrew Bequette, Att
orney at Law, of
                            Urbana, Illinois as guardian ad litem with respect t
o the finding and
                            to advise the court with regard to the prospect of i
nitiating a
                            separate guardianship proceeding under the Probate A
ct in the interest
                            of the defendant. The court grants Mr. Bequette leav
e of court to file
                            a petition for guardianship at his sole discretion.
                            The court notes that this case is allotted for a sta

                            December 12, 2013 at 11:30 in courtroom 'D.' On the
motion of the

                            and receipt of his interim report to the court. Elec

r content. The
                            court reminds all counsel of record that the attache

                            subject to various privileges and that there is to b
