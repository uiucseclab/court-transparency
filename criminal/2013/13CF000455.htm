                            pro se.  Cause called for hearing on the People's Motion to Strike
                            Defendant's Amended Motion to Withdraw Guilty Plea and Vacate Sentence
                            and the Defendant Answer to People Motion to Strike Defendant Amended
                            Motion to Withdraw Guilty Plea and Vacate Sentence.  Arguments of

                            Order Remanding Individual to Illinois Department of Corrections
                            following Satisfaction of Writ entered.
   07-09-14                 Pro Se correspondence on file by defendant. File stamped copy returned
                            to defendant, along with a copy of the docket.
   07-14-14                 The Court considered the PEOPLE'S MOTION TO STRIKE DEFENDANT'S
                            AMENDED MOTION TO WITHDRAW GUILTY PLEA AND VACATE SENTENCE and
                            DEFENDANT ANSWER TO PEOPLE MOTION TO STRIKE DEFENDANT AMENDED MOTION
                            TO WITHDRAW GUILTY PLEA AND VACATE SENTENCE.  An order allowing
                            withdrawal of a guilty plea, as Defendant requests, is appropriate
                            where the plea was entered through a misapprehension of the facts or
                            the law or where there is a doubt as to the guilt of the accused and
                            justice would be better served through a trial, People v. Hughes, 2012
                            IL 112 817, 983 N.E. 2d 439, 368 Ill. Dec. 26 (2012).  In his AMENDED
                            MOTION TO WITHDRAW GUILTY PLEA AND VACATE THE SENTENCE, Defendant
                            alleges, inter alia, that he was "pressured" into pleading guilty by
                            his trial counsel, that the People presented perjured testimony and
                            altered physical evidence at trial, that his trial counsel failed to
                            impeach the
                            testimony of a key witness for the People and/or present evidence to
                            rebut her testimony, and that he was improperly sentenced.  To
                            determine the claims in Defendant's motion, the Court would be
                            required to consider evidence as to conversations that occurred out of
                            the Court's presence and documents that were not presented at trial.
                            As Defendant's appeal rights are implicated, the Court has determined
                            that an evidentiary hearing as to Defendant's AMENDED MOTION TO
                            WITHDRAW GUILTY PLEA AND VACATE THE SENTENCE is needed.
                            Relief requested in the PEOPLE'S MOTION TO STRIKE DEFENDANT'S AMENDED
                            MOTION TO WITHDRAW GUILTY PLEA AND VACATE SENTENCE is denied.
                            Defendant's AMENDED MOTION TOWITHDRAW GUILTY PLEA AND VACATE THE
                            SENTENCE is allowed for hearing 1:30 p.m., August 19, 2014, Courtroom
