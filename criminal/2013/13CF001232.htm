                            Defendant appears in custody and with LeRoy Cross.  Cause called for
                            hearing on the People's motion for continuance for forensic testing
                            filed October 8, 2013 and People's motion for continuance filed
                            November 4, 2013.  Upon reconsideration of the motion for continuance
                            filed October 8, 2013, based on the defendant's claim of lack of
                            proper notice and request for adversarial hearing, court finds that
                            after consideration of the verified allegations in the People's motion
                            for continuance due diligence has been demonstrated by the People.
                            People's request for a continuance for forensic testing is granted.
                            After adversarial hearing in regard to the People's verified motion
                            for continuance filed November 4, 2013, court finds the People have
                            exercised due diligence.  Motion for continuance is granted.   Cause
                            called for hearing on the People's motion to consume physical evidence
                            for laboratory analysis filed November 4, 2013.  No objection
                            interposed by counsel for the defendant.  Motion to consume physical
                            evidence for laboratory analysis allowed.  Written order to consume
                            physical evidence for laboratory analysis entered.  Cause called for
                            hearing on the Defendant's motion to dismiss pursuant to County
                            Administrative Order 05-07 filed November 8, 2013.  Arguments of
                            counsel heard.  Defendant's motion to dismiss pursuant to County
                            Administrative Order 05-07 is denied.  Court finds the delay between
                            November 4, 2013 and this date was caused by Mr. Cross and his request
                            for adversarial hearing.  Cause allotted for Pre-Trial on January 7,
                            2014 at 11:00 a.m. in Courtroom A.  Bond previously established to
