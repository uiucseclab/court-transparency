                            See Order.  The Court finds the petition fails to st
ate a claim for
                            relief under 735 ILCS 5/2-1401.  The petition is bot
h legally and
                            factually insufficient, it lacks any arguable factua
l basis and there
                            is no evidentiary support for the petitioner's alleg
ations.  The
                            issues raised in the petition seeking post-judgment
relief are
                            frivolous and patently without merit.  The Court ord
ers summary
                            judgment for the State and against the petitioner on
 the pleadings and
                            the petitioner's request for post judgment relief is
 denied.
