   11-01-13       
                            "The court notes in the wake of the judgment of acquittal on count I
                            of the information, entered on October 31, the September 6 filing of a
                            second count of the information alleging the offense of battery. The
                            court further notes that count II was not called for trial with count
                            I and that no disposition of it has been sought by either party.
                            Accordingly, the court allots count II for a status hearing on
                            November 21 at 8:00 in courtroom 'D.' Counsel for the parties notified
                            of the entry of the foregoing by electronic mail this date with the
                            same to serve as notice of hearing. The court further notes that count
                            II is apparently amenable to a plea in bar pursuant to Article 3 of
                            the Criminal Code. Accordingly, should the State of Illinois chose to
                            dismiss count II for that or any reason the court will entertain a
                            motion to dismiss by electronic mail, in which case the allotment of
                            November 21 will be vacated."
