   02-25-16                 Docket Entry
                            Defendant's Motion to Vacate Judgment and Order file
d February 22,
                            2016, is DENIED AS PREMATURE.  The Court has not yet
 entered any order
                            on the State's Motion to Dismiss, and Defendant's Pe
tition for Relief
                            from Judgment filed December 28, 2015, is STILL PEND
ING.  The Court's
                            docket entry of February 4, 2016, merely set a deadl
ine for Defendant
                            to file a Response to the State's Motion to Dismiss
by March 4, 2016,
                            but Defendant's Motion to Vacate reflects a mistaken
 belief that the
                            Court had ruled on the State's Motion.  The deadline
 for Defendant to
                            file a Response to the State's Motion to Dismiss is
extended to March
                            31, 2016.
