   11-13-13                 The Court has considered the STATE'S MOTION TO ADMIT
                            STATEMENTS UNDER 725 ILCS 115-10.  The Court considered the testimony
                            presented at the hearings herein on September 23, 2013 and October 8,
                            2013.
                            Pursuant to the statutory hearsay exception created by 725 ILCS
                            5/115-10, the State seeks to present at trial testimony as to
                            statements made by the alleged victim named in COUNT ONE of the
                            INFORMATION to her mother, Jamie Hermansen, her grandmother, Denise
                            Sheldon, Thomasboro Police Officer Michael Martinez, and DCFS Child
                            Protective Investigator Janis Caffrey about conduct of the Defendant
                            which the state charges constitutes the offense of
                            AGGRAVATED CRIMINAL SEXUAL ABUSE.  The Court finds that the testimony
                            regarding the time, content, and circumstances of each statement
                            provides sufficient indicia of reliability to permit testimony in
                            regard to such statements to be presented at trial.   State's motion
                            as to such statements is allowed.
                            The State also seeks to present at trial pursuant to 725 ILCS 5/115-10
                            testimony as to statements made by the alleged victim named in COUNT
                            TWO of the INFORMATION to Thomasboro Police Chief  Keith Willis and
                            DCFS Child Protection Specialist Demetria Candler about conduct of the
                            Defendant which the state charges constitutes the offense of
                            AGGRAVATED CRIMINAL SEXUAL ABUSE.  The Court finds that the time,
                            content and circumstances of the statements of the alleged victim to
                            Police Chief Willis provide sufficient indicia of reliability to
                            permit testimony in regard to such statements to be presented at
                            trial.  State's motion as to the statements made by the alleged victim
                            to Police Chief Willis is allowed.
                            The statements made by the alleged victim to Child Protection
                            Specialist Candler were made during an interview at the Child Advocacy
                            Center.  The Court viewed the video recording made during the
                            interview.  Child Protection Specialist Candler properly conducted the
                            interview pursuant to the RATAC child interview protocol.  From her
                            demeanor, conduct and responses to Candler's questions, the alleged
                            victim appeared to be distracted and not to be fully involved in the
                            interview.  The Court finds that the time, content and circumstances
                            of the statements of the alleged victim to Child Protection Specialist
                            Candler during the Child Advocacy Center interview do not provide
                            sufficient indicia of reliability to permit testimony in regard to
                            such statements to be presented at trial.  State's motion as the
                            statements made by the alleged victim to Child Protection Specialist
                            Candler is denied.
