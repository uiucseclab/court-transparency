                            "The court notes in the wake of the judgment of acqu
ittal on count I
                            of the information, entered on October 31, the Septe
mber 6 filing of a
                            second count of the information alleging the offense
 of battery. The
                            court further notes that count II was not called for
 trial with count
                            I and that no disposition of it has been sought by e
ither party.
                            Accordingly, the court allots count II for a status
hearing on
                            November 21 at 8:00 in courtroom 'D.' Counsel for th
e parties notified
                            of the entry of the foregoing by electronic mail thi
s date with the
                            same to serve as notice of hearing. The court furthe
r notes that count
                            II is apparently amenable to a plea in bar pursuant
to Article 3 of
                            the Criminal Code. Accordingly, should the State of
Illinois chose to
                            dismiss count II for that or any reason the court wi
ll entertain a
                            motion to dismiss by electronic mail, in which case
the allotment of
                            November 21 will be vacated."
