                            documents attached to the motion of the State to take judicial notice,
                            the court finds that there exists reason to believe that the defendant
                            is a disabled adult as defined in Article 11a of the Probate Act.
                            Accordingly, the court appoints Andrew Bequette, Attorney at Law, of
                            Urbana, Illinois as guardian ad litem with respect to the finding and
                            to advise the court with regard to the prospect of initiating a
                            separate guardianship proceeding under the Probate Act in the interest
                            of the defendant. The court grants Mr. Bequette leave of court to file
                            a petition for guardianship at his sole discretion.
                            The court notes that this case is allotted for a status hearing to
                            December 12, 2013 at 11:30 in courtroom 'D.' On the motion of the
                            court the case is further allotted for the appearance of Mr. Bequette
                            and receipt of his interim report to the court. Electronic
                            correspondence sent to counsel of record this date notifying them of
                            the entry of the foregoing order. Electronic copy of the motion to
                            take judicial notice and the attached documents are to be sent to Mr.
                            Bequette by separate electronic mail this date. The court places the
                            motion and attached documents under seal, given their content. The
                            court reminds all counsel of record that the attached documents are
                            subject to various privileges and that there is to be no secondary
                            dissemination of them without prior leave of court."

                            "The court notes the electronic mail from Mr. Bequette suggesting that
                            he is unable to proceed as guardian ad litem. Accordingly, his
                            appointment is vacated. The court now appoints Kristen Fischer as
                            guardian ad litem for Mr. Wesley with the same direction and authority
                            vested in Mr. Bequette by the docket order of November 27. The cause
                            remains allotted for a status hearing on December 12 at 11:30 in
                            courtroom 'D.' Ms. Fischer and counsel of record are notified of the
                            entry of the foregoing by electronic mail this date, with the text of
                            the November 27 docket order included for ease of reference by Ms.
                            Fischer. Electronic copy of the referenced motion to take judicial
                            notice and the attached documents are to be sent by the court to Ms.
                            Fischer by separate electronic mail this date."
