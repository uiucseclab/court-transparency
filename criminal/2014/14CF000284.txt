                            This Court has considered the MOTION FOR REDUCTION O
F SENTENCE, filed
                            on September 28, 2015 by Defendant Charles D. Meeks.
  On August 15,
                            2014, this Court sentenced Defendant Meeks to 8 year
s incarceration in
                            the Illinois Department of Corrections for the offen
se of unlawful
                            possession with intent to deliver a controlled subst
ance, Class 1
                            felony eligible for extended term sentencing.  At th
e request of
                            Defendant and his counsel, the Court recommended tha
t the Defendant
                            receive anger management treatment and substance abu
se treatment and
                            counseling while incarcerated.  This recommendation
was incorporated
                            into the JUDGMENT-SENTENCE TO ILLINOIS DEPARTMENT OF
 CORRECTIONS
                            entered on August 15, 2014.  Whether an inmate is al
lowed to
                            participate in any program offered by the Department
 of Corrections is
                            within the discretion of the Department.  It is unfo
rtunate that
                            Defendant has been denied substance abuse treatment
and counseling by
                            the Department of Corrections, however, such denial
does not provide a
                            basis for modification of this Court's sentence.  Ac
ting sua sponte,
                            the Court orders that the relief requested in Defend
ant's MOTION FOR
                            REDUCTION OF SENTENCE is denied.
