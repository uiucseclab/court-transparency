                            thereof, filed on October 30, 2014 by Petitioner Tav
arus C. Murray,
                            considered.  Motion is allowed.  Petitioner is grant
ed leave to
                            proceed in forma pauperis.   POST-CONVICTION PETITIO
N PETITION FOR
                            SENTENCE REDUCTION considered.  It is unclear whethe
r Petitioner
                            intends his Petition to be considered as a motion fo
r post plea
                            relief, a petition for relief pursuant to the Post-C
onviction Hearing
                            Act, or both.  If Petitioner intends the Petition to
 be considered as
                            a motion for post plea relief, the Petition is untim
ely and not in the
                            proper form.  At the time Petitioner's fully negotia
ted guilty plea
                            was accepted by the Court, he was admonished that, i
f he wished to
                            appeal the conviction and sentence, he would need to
 file a motion to
                            withdraw his guilty plea and vacate the judgment wit
hin 30 days.  As
                            Petitioner has not filed a motion to withdraw his gu
ilty and vacate
                            the judgment, he has forfeited his right to proceed
by direct appeal.
