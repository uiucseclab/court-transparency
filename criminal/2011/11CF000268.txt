                            "The court notes defendant's motion to amend or corr
ect the mittimus,
                            filed August 30, 2012.  The court dispenses with bri
efing and oral
                            argument on the motion pursuant to circuit rule 2.1(
c).  The court
                            holds that section 5-4-1(c-1) of the Code of Correct
ions has no
                            application to the present record.  The court furthe
r notes that
                            defendant was convicted of an offense of which great
 bodily harm is
                            elemental and that in all events sentence credit for
 the offense of
                            aggravated driving under the influence of alcohol is
 governed by
                            section 3-6-3(a)(2.6) of the Code of Corrections.  T
he court therefore
                            holds that any forbearance of the court to make the
finding required
                            by section 5-4-1(c-1) in this case is not a matter o
f consequence to
                            the validity of the sentence or to the sentence cred
it to which
                            defendant is entitled.  The court accordingly finds
that defendant's
                            motion is without merit and the motion is therefore
DENIED.  No
                            written order is required."
