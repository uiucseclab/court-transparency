   02-08-13                 Mandate from Appellate Court regarding Gen No: 4-12-
0399.
                            Defendant, the appellee in this case, has not filed
a brief or
                            otherwise responded to the state's notice of appeal.
  It is unclear
                            whether defendant ever received the State's notice o
f appeal where the
                            State's brief, initially sent to the same address as
 the notice of
                            appeal, was returned.  That question notwithstanding
, it appears from
                            the record the State's Notice of Appeal was never se
nt to defendant's
                            retained trial counsel.  Supreme Court Rule 603(e)(3
) provides where,
                            as here, the State is the appellant, "a copy of the
notice of appeal
                            shall be sent to the defendant and a copy to his cou
nsel."
                            Additionally, Supreme Court Rule 607(a) provides "in
 cases in which
                            the State appeals, the trial court shall determine w
hether the
                            defendant is represented by counsel on appeal.  If n
ot so represented,
                            and the court determines that the defendant is indig
ent and desires
                            counsel on appeal, the court shall appoint counsel o
n appeal." Nothing
                            in the record indicates the trial court determined w
hether defendant
                            was represented by counsel on appeal.  Accordingly,
we REMAND this
                            matter to the trial court for a hearing on whether t
he State's notice
                            of appeal was appropriately mailed to defendant at h
is last known
                            address, the effect of failing to mail a copy of the
 notice of appeal
                            to defendant's trial counsel, whether defendant's tr
ial counsel
                            continues to represent him on appeal, and, if not, w
hether defendant
                            requires the appointment of counsel to represent him
 on appeal.
                            Notice of actions taken on this remand order to be p
rovided to the
                            Fourth District Appellate Court.
