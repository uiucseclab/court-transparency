  The
                            drafters of the Illinois Pattern Jury Instructions r
ecommended that no
                            instruction defining "reasonable doubt" be given, Il

linois Supreme
                            Court has held that it is prejudicial error to give
such instruction,
                            People v. Cagle, 41 Ill. 2d 528, 536, 244 N.E. 200,
204 (1969).  It
                            did not constitute ineffective assistance of counsel
 for Defendant's
                            trial counsel to have failed to tender a non IPI ins
truction defining
                            reasonable doubt to be read to the jury when the jur
y requested such a
                            definition and was not a violation of Defendant's co
nstitutional
                            rights for the Court to have declined, sua sponte, t
o have given such
                            an instruction.  People's motion to dismiss Defendan
t's
                            post-conviction claims based upon the Court's failur
e to give an
                            instruction defining reasonable doubt to the jury is
 allowed.  Such
                            claims are ordered dismissed.  The Court has determi
ned that the
                            remaining claims in Defendant's AMENDED POST-CONVICT
