ender Anthony
                            Ortega.  Cause called for fitness hearing.  The Cour
t notes the
                            fitness report of Lawrence L. Jeckel, M.D. filed her
ein 3/3/2011.
                            Attorney Clifton and attorney Ortega stipulate that
the Court may
                            consider the contents of that report for this hearin
g.  Based upon the
                            contents of the fitness report of the Defendant the
Court finds the
                            Defendant is unfit at this time to stand trial.  The
 Court further
                            finds that the Defendant may be restored to fitness
within 1 year with
                            appropriate mental health treatment.  It will be the
 order of the
                            Court, that the Defendant be placed in the custody o
f the IDHS which
                            shall determine the appropriate placement appropriat
e treatment of the
                            Defendant.  The Champaign County Sheriff shall trans
port the Defendant
                            to the appropriate placement as determined by DHS.
The Department
                            shall within 30 days indicate an opinion as to the p
robability of the
                            Defendant attaining fitness within 1 year.  If there
 is a proability
                            that the Defendant will attain fitness within 1 year
, the Department
                            shall file a treatment plan which shall include a de
scription of
                            treatment goals, specification of the proposed treat
ment and an
                            estimated time table for attaining the goals.  The n
ame of the person
                            supervising the Defendant's treatment shall be provi
ded to the Court.
                            If the Department believes that either the Defendant
 has attained
                            fitness or there is a not a probability that the Def
endant shall
                            attain fitness within 1 year, it shall notify the Co
urt and a hearing
                            to determine fitness shall be set forth.  Cause will
