                            the same.  Finding Defendant knowingly, understandin

   05-08-12
                            Court notes the Defendant's Motion to Reconsider Sen
tence on Contempt
                            on file 05/03/12. The Motion asserts that the court
order is silent as
                            to the Defendant's eligibility for good time. It is
correct that the
                            order is silent on that issue. If the Defendant wasn
't eligible for
                            good time, the order would so specify. The relevant
act excepts only
                            sentences for civil contempt, and therefore, the Def
endant is eligible
                            for good time. The portion of the motion seeking "a
lesser sentence"
                            is denied. No Written Order required.
                            Subpoena Served.  No Fees.

n the Petition to
