                            Motion to Dismiss on file.
   08-25-15                 Plaintiff Calvin Rexroad, currently incarcerated at
the Jacksonville
                            Correctional Center, requests that this Court order
his release from
                            incarceration pursuant to the HABEAS CORPUS ACT, 735
 ILCS 5/10-101 et
                            seq., alleging he has served the 'legal' portion of
his sentence.
                            Plaintiff was convicted of the offense of indecent
solicitation of a
                            child.  On October 14, 2011, Petitioner was sentence
d to a period of
                            incarceration in the Illinois Department of Correcti
ons of eight years
                            to be followed by a one-year period of mandatory
                            supervised release.  The remedy of habeas corpus is
available only to
                            obtain the release of a prisoner who has been incarc
erated under a
                            judgment of an original trial court which lacked jur
isdiction of the
                            subject matter or of the person of the defendant, or
 where there has
                            been some occurrence subsequent to the prisoner's co
nviction which
                            entitles the prisoner to his release.  Plaintiff's H
abeas Corpus
                            Petition Pursuant to 735 ILCS 5/10-124-1 et seq. doe
s not allege that
                            the judgment of conviction and sentencing orders of
this Court are
                            void for lack of subject matter jurisdiction or juri
sdiction over
                            Plaintiff at the time the orders were entered.  Plai
ntiff does not
                            allege that he has served the maximum sentence impos
ed by the Court,
                            including the one-year period of mandatory supervise
d release included
                            therein, or that there has been any other occurrence
 subsequent to his
                            conviction that entitles him to be released from cus
tody.  Acting sua
                            sponte, the Court grants Respondent's MOTION TO DISM
ISS pursuant to
                            735 ILCS 5/2-615.  Plaintiff's Habeas Corpus Petitio
n Pursuant to 735
                            ILCS 5/10-124-1 et seq. is ordered dismissed with pr
ejudice.  No
                            written order is required.
