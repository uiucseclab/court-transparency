                            Sentencing hearing in progress resumed.  Asst. State

                            tenders to the Court an exhibit which is marked as P
eople's Exhibit #4
                            and will be considered in connection together with a

                            evidence in the sentencing hearing.  Additional test
imony presented on
                            behalf of the defendant.  Recommendations as to a se

 address the

                            specifically considered statutory and non-statutory
factors in
                            aggravation and in mitigation.  The Court has, as it
 is required to do
                            by State law, considered a community based sentence
as a first
                            sentencing option.  The Court has sought to fashion
a sentence that
                            would be consistent with the severity of the offense
 committed by the
                            defendant and serve as a deterrent to others who mig
ht consider
                            committing such offense.  The Court has considered t
he rehabilitative
                            potential of the defendant.  It will be the order of
 the Court:  that
                            the defendant be sentenced to a term of probation of
 48 months,
                            standard terms of such a sentence as set out in an o
rder of conditions
                            to be entered will be applicable; specific condition
s will be that the
                            defendant serve a term of incarceration in the Champ
aign County
                            Correctional Center of 129 days, defendant will rece
