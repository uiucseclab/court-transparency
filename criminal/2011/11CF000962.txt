                            deprived of liberty where the judgment or proceeding
 under which he or
                            she is detained is void or where detention has
                            become unlawful because of some subsequent act, omis
sion or event.
                            Petitioner Wheeler has filed no petition or other
                            pleading seeking habeas corpus relief. If Petitioner
 wishes to pursue
                            a habeas corpus cause action, he cannot do so
                            within this cause, but instead, must file a separate
, civil cause of
                            action. MEMORANDUM OF LAW IN SUPPORT OF
                            WRIT PETITION FOR HABEAS CORPUS RELIEF is ordered st
