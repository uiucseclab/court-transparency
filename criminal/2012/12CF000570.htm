                            posted is to be applied first to any court ordered bond assignment on
                            file and then to all restitution ordered and then to all financial
                            obligations in this case.  Any remaining bond shall be discharged to
                            the individual who posted the bond. Counts I and II are hereby
                            dismissed. The Defendant has been advised of the rights of a Defendant
                            under Supreme Court Rule 605 and the court finds that the Defendant
                            understands those rights.
