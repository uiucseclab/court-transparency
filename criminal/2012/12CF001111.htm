                            with 730 ILCS 5/5-4-3. The State agrees not to file a Petition to
                            Revoke in the case(s) specified in the written order based solely on
                            the basis of this conviction. Defendant advised of right to appeal and
                            rights pursuant to Supreme Court Rule 605 and the Court finds that the
                            defendant understands the same.
