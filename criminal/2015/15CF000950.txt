                            Appearance of the People by Scott A. Larson.  Appear
ance of the
                            Defendant personally and by counsel, Lindsey R. Yanc
hus.  Sentencing
                            hearing in progress resumed.  Mr. Larson and Ms. Yan
chus indicate they
                            have reviewed the transcripts of the proceedings on
September 21,
                            2015.  Review of the said transcript reveals as to a
 question posed to
                            him by the Court, that the defendant indicated he un
derstood if he
                            pleaded guilty to the offense of Possession of Firea
rm without FOID, a
                            class 3 felony, he was saying that there's evidence
that the State's
                            attorney's office could produce at trial that would
be sufficient to
                            convince a judge or jury beyond a reasonable doubt t
hat the defendant
                            actually committed to offense.  Thereafter Assistant
 State's Attorney
                            Larson made a factual basis proffer.  Assistant Publ
ic Defender
                            Yanchus stipulated that the defendant did not have a
 FOID case and
                            upon search by the Police Department, the night of t
he arrest, did
                            find a handgun in his possession.  Court finds the s
tipulation was
                            sufficient to establish the elements of the offense
charged by the
                            People.  All financial obligations shall be paid in
equal monthly
                            installments to the Champaign County Circuit Clerk b
y  5/02/2016.  Any
                            bond posted is to be applied first to any court orde
red bond
                            assignment on file and then to all restitution order
ed and then to all
                            financial obligations in this case.  Any remaining b
ond shall be
                            discharged to the individual who posted the bond.  D
efendant is
                            ordered to serve a period of  30 months probation. D
efendant is
                            ordered to serve a period of incarceration of 180 da
ys in the
                            Champaign County Correctional Center. Defendant is t
