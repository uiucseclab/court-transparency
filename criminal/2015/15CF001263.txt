                            ADDITION TO THE DOCKET ENTRY OF APRIL 21, 2016:

   04-27-16                 People's Response to Defendant's Motion to Dismiss (
Forgery) on file
   04-28-16                 The court has reviewed three large envelopes contain
ing assorted
                            documents from IDOC concerning the defendant for Gar
rity rights
                            violations.  It has designated those three envelopes
 as "Envelope #1",
                            "Envelope #2", and "Envelope #3" respectively.  The
court finds no
                            Garrity rights violations in any of the material.  T
he court's clerk
                            is directed to release to defense counsel copies of
all such documents
                            after placing them in envelopes correspondingly desi
gnated as
                            "Envelope #1", "Envelope #2", and "Envelope #3".
   04-29-16                 The court notes that this case was originally on the
 calendar of Judge
                            Harry Clem, and that Judge Harry Clem heard argument
s on the
                            Defendant's Combined Motion to Dismiss Pursuant to S
ection 114-1 on
                            February 18, 2016.  Judge Clem has been absent from
the bench due to
                            illness since February 22, 2016, and has been unable
 to attend to any
                            judicial business since that date.  It is unclear wh
en Judge Harry
                            Clem may be able to return to the bench.  As a resul
t, Presiding Judge
                            Thomas Difanis ruled on the Defendant's Combined Mot
ion to Dismiss
