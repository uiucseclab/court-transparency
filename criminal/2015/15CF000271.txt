 date.  People
                            present no additional evidence in mitigation, docume
ntary evidence and
                            testimony presented on behalf of the defendant, and

son and Asst.
                            Public Defender Allegretti considered.  The defendan
t is afforded an
                            opportunity to address the Court.  Court has conside
red the matters in
                            aggravation and mitigation.  Court has sought to ent
er an order that
                            would be consistent with the offense committed by th
e defendant and
                            serve as a deterrence to those who might consider co
mmitting a similar
                            offense.   Court has considered the rehabilitative p
otential of the
                            defendant.  Court has, as it is required to by State
 law, considered a
                            community based sentence as a sentence alternative.
 Having considered
                            all relevant information it is the order of the Cour
t that the
                            defendant will be sentenced to the Illinois Departme
nt of Corrections
                            for a period of 4 years.  Defendant will receive cre
dit against his
                            sentence of 2 days representing time that he was in
custody prior to
                            today's hearing.  Defendant will pay all statutory f
ines, fees and
                            costs as set out in a sentencing order and order for
 payment of fines.
                            As to any assessments considered to be a fine, defen
dant will receive
                            credit of $10.00 based upon the 2 days he was in cus
tody.  Defendant's
                            order of incarceration will be followed by 2 years m
andatory
                            supervised release as required by Illinois law.  Def
endant is advised
                            of his appellate rights, the Court finds he understa
nd those rights.
                            Defendant is remanded to the custody of the Champaig
n County Sheriff
                            for transportation to the Illinois Department of Cor
