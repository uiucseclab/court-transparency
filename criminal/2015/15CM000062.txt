                            People appear by Stephanie Hall. Defendant appears p
ersonally, and by
                            counsel, Tony Fiorentino. Cause called for hearing o
n the Motion to
                            Suppress. Defendant's Exhibit #2, #3 and #1 are admi
tted. Arguments of
                            counsel. Defendant's Motion to Suppress Evidence is
granted,
                            violations of the Fourth and Fourteenth Amendments t
o the United
                            States Constitution being found as follows:  The Cou
rt finds that the
                            detention of Defendant after 4:25 p.m. on January 17
, 2015, as shown
                            in Defendant's Exhibit 2, exceeded the time reasonab
ly required to
                            complete the purposes of the traffic stop, as the K-
9 search was
                            completed at 4:21 p.m. and was negative, leaving the
 original purpose
                            of the stop, citing traffic violations, as the sole
basis to justify
                            further detention pursuant to Rodriguez v. United St
ates, 135 S.Ct.
                            1609 (2015), and petty traffic tickets could and sho
uld have been
                            issued prior to 4:25 p.m.  While Defendant was told
that he was free
                            to go, this was not done until 4:41 p.m., and the Co
urt finds that at
                            this point, his unlawful detention had impaired his
ability to arrange
                            alternate transportation or otherwise leave the area
, so that he was
                            still present at the scene at 4:45 p.m. when the off
icer questioned
                            him about the item recovered and arrested him.  Ther
efore, any and all
                            statements made by Defendant after 4:25 p.m. are sup
pressed and
                            excluded as evidence, and witnesses are prohibited f
rom referring to
                            them.  However, the Court finds that the search of t
he vehicle was not
                            the product, or fruit of the poisonous tree, of this
 Rodriguez
                            violation, as it resulted from the detention and sea
rch of the
                            vehicle, which did not belong to Defendant, and not
the detention of
                            the Defendant himself.  Nonetheless, Defendant's Mot
ion is granted as
                            to the search of the vehicle because it was the prod
uct of an unlawful
                            inventory search that was not permitted by standardi
zed police policy
                            as required under Colorado v. Bertine, 479 U.S. 367
(1987) and People
                            v. Gipson, 203 Ill.2d 298 (2003), namely Champaign P
olice Department
                            Policy Number 61.5, admitted into evidence as Defend
ant's Exhibit 1.
                            All items recovered as a result of that search are s
uppressed and
                            excluded as evidence, and witnesses are prohibited f
rom referring to
                            them.  Further, the Court finds that Defendant's sta
tements after the
                            unlawful inventory search of the vehicle were the pr
oduct, or fruit of
                            the poisonous tree, of that unlawful inventory searc
h, as they were
                            the result of questioning by officers in light of th
e discovery of
                            items in the vehicle.  Defendant's statements after
the search are
                            therefore suppressed and excluded as evidence on thi
s independent
                            ground, as well as the ground stated earlier, and wi
tnesses are
                            prohibited from referring to them. No written Order
required.
