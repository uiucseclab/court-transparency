 fitness within
                            one year of the original finding of unfitness; and I
t Is Therefore
                            Ordered That:  the defendant shall remain in the cus

te of the original
                            finding of unfitness.  The progress report shall con

                            fitness within one year from the date of the origina
l date of
                            unfitness.  If the defendant is receiving medication
