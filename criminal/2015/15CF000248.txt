                            Original report filed in 15-CF-241.
                            Cause is called for hearing
                            People appear by Mr. Banach.  Defendant appears by a
ttorney Ms.
                            Miller-Jones.  The appearance of the defendant is wa
ived so as not to
                            disrupt his treatment.  Cause is called for review h
earing on the
                            defendant's Department of Human Services Treatment.
 The Court finds
                            that the defendant is still not fit to plead or stan
d trial and is
                            making substantial progress toward the attainment of
 fitness within
                            one year of the original finding of unfitness; and I
t Is Therefore
                            Ordered That:  the defendant shall remain in the cus
tody of the
                            Illinois Department of Human Services to be held in
a secure setting.
                            The Department of Human Services will continue to pr
ovide appropriate
                            treatment for the defendant.  The treatment supervis
or shall, pursuant
                            to 725 ILCS 5/140-18, submit a written progress repo
rt to the court,
                            the State and the defense:  at least 7 days prior to
 the date for any
                            hearing on the issue of the defendant's fitness; whe
never he believes
                            that the defendant has attained fitness; whenever he
 believes that
                            there is not a substantial probability that the defe
ndant will attain
                            fitness, with treatment, within one year from the da
te of the original
                            finding of unfitness.  The progress report shall con
tain:  the
                            clinical findings of the treatment supervisor and th
e facts upon which
                            the findings are based.  The opinion of the treatmen
t supervisor as to
                            whether the defendant has attained fitness or as to
whether the
                            defendant is mailing progress, under treatment, towa
rd attaining
                            fitness within one year from the date of the origina
l date of
                            unfitness.  If the defendant is receiving medication
, information from
                            the prescribing physician indicating the type, the d
osage and the
                            effect of the medication on the defendant's appearan
ce, actions and
